## Reflection Document

### HTML

- Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

  - I watched the videos, took notes, and then did my best to recreate from memory the code that was shared in the videos.
  - I also did my best to add additional elements to 03 and 04 such as adding extra information (more rows of Spongebob characters) or extra functionality (the form actually submits to my @pdx.edu email address)

- How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

  - I really enjoyed the form exercise since it used a variety of elements and was interesting to put together. I already knew a little HTML but definitely learned more, and I especially enjoyed using the accessbility audit since I had never considered that aspect of web design before.

- Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

  - I was a little confused at first of how to set up a remote repository that's different from the one we're actively working in; in the past I've only ever cloned repos, not forked them. This concept was introduced with different wording in 2 different places:
    - setup.md file had 'labs' for the original repo
    - Slides 02 - Git file had 'upstream' for the original repo
    - Obviously not a huge difference, but just wanted to point that out

- Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?
  - I think this week was a good intro to some HTML basics and I look forward to more customization and interactiveness in the coming weeks with CSS and Javascript

- Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?
  - I have been learning a lot by watching the videos, taking notes, and then doing my best to complete the exercise from memory, based on my notes. I did not need to go back to reference the video after watching it.
- How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?
  - I found this exercise pretty similar to the "Form" exercise in 01-html, because we also had to run the WAVE audit then, and fix the labeling issues.
- Was there something that you wish had been explained better?
  - I believe the videos and instructions were clear for this week
- Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?
  - I would have liked to try something with background images and text color and placement, like how in the one video it showed how text can have good contrast on one part of the image but bad contrast on another. It would have been interesting to do more hands-on work with contrast errors.
