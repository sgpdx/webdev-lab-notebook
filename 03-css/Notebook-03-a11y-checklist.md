## Checklist

Prior to turning in your assignment, complete the following checklist in regards to the code checks. There are several errors in the starter files that you will need to fix.

#### Accessibility Code Check

- [x] Use the Wave AIM browser extension to run an accessibility audit on your completed solutions.
  - No errors found
  - Some "warnings" which pertained to the page structure, such as "missing 1st level heading" but I ignored these since the focus is on the content for these exercises and adding a heading that is not in the screenshot would be a violation of the exericse, since it wouldn't match up to the screenshot any more

#### Formatted Code Check

- [x] Use Prettier to properly format your HTML code.
- [x] Use Prettier to properly format your CSS code.
- [x] Use Prettier to properly format your JavaScript code.
  - N/A
